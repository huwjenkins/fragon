# Fragon

Fragon is a pipeline for molecular replacement in which fragments (ideal α-helices or β-strands) are placed using Phaser [1] and the phases calculated from these coordinates are improved by the density-modification methods provided by ACORN [2]. The reliable scoring algorithm provided by ACORN identifies successful cases and the resulting phases are usually of sufficient quality to enable automated model building of the entire structure.
